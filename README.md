# 3manNEW

* independent, extracurricular project

- After finding out about 3 man chess, buying the the official board game (http://3manchess.com), and playing countless games with friends, the next logical step was of course to implement the game in Python. 


- **3manNEW** is a "pass n' play" style 3 person chess game modeled after the board game.
- **3manNEW** allows 3 players to enter their names and begin a game
- The engine permits only legal moves from the players, and the pieces do not move when the attempted move is illegal
- Detects check and checkmate
- Python Libraries used:
  - Tkinter
  - time
  - pygame
  - math
  - os
